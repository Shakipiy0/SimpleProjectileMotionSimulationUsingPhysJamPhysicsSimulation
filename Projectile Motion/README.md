# Physics-Simulation-C++-Qt-Programming

created by Julio Morgado

This is a basic physics simulation using custom QGraphicsItems in the Qt framework. This project includes custom classes that will be periodically updated. Feel free to use this code for educational purposes and/or share suggestions to make the code more efficient.
